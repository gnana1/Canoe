1. Make the automation test (use an environment that you’re most familiar with. Such as Selenium, Cypress, etc.) that covers MarkJs configurator.
a. The test should:
i. Open the MarkJs configurator (​https://markjs.io/configurator.html​).
ii. Fill out the form to allow to search for word “lorem” (case insensitive).
iii. Assert that there is a correct number of marked matches.
b. Within the same test adjust form so that it will search for case sensitive matches only and check for results.
